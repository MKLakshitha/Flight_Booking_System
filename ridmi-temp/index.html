                <h1>How COVID-19 spreads</h1>
                <p>
                    When someone who has COVID-19 coughs or exhales they release droplets of infected fluid.
                    Most of these droplets fall on nearby surfaces and objects - such as desks, tables or telephones.<br>
                    People could catch COVID-19 by touching contaminated surfaces or objects and then touching their eyes,
                    nose or mouth.If they are standing within one meter of a person with COVID-19 they <br>can catch it by 
                    breathing in droplets coughed out or exhaled by them.In other words,COVID-19 spreads in a similar way 
                    to flu. Most persons infected with COVID-19 experience mild symptoms <br>and recover.
                    However, some go on to experience more serious illness and may require hospital care.
                    Risk of serious illness rises with age people over 40 seem to be more vulnerable than those <br>under 40.
                    People with weakened immune systems and people with conditions such as diabetes,
                    heart and lung disease are also more vulnerable to serious illness.
